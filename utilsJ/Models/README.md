# bunch of functios to simulate extended PSIAM and related

* alex_bayes_clean: implementation of expectation maximization alorithm to fit jerk to trajectories suggested by Hyafil. A. You can find his non-public disclosure [here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5fae56a2878ad0dd1ca7472d). It also has a trial class which might help in particular scenarios when you need to retrive info from a tabular source (ComPipe generated data)  
* min_jerk: code found elsewhere. Copyright (C) Emanuel Todorov, 1998-2006 Python implementation by Dogancan Kebude  
* lluis_sim.m:  Hern√°ndez-Navarro L. code (matlab) to simulate psiam
* psiam_legacy: first attempt to port it to python (deprecated)
* simul & traj: code to simulate extended psiam (psiam and trajectories)
