# custom_utils
few python util functions I use regularly (or used to :suspect:) when working in brain circuits and behavior lab.  
install within a python3 environment with `pip install -e .`  

I attempted to segment functionallities into Behavior/Models, however the division is not really that simple (eg. 2AFC glm is inside Behavior). 
Check respective readmes to find out more.  

In the top directory there are two unclassified scripts  
* one openephys modified to transform continuous to .dat
* regularimports. My favourite libraries So I can import them all using a non orthodox way in my notebooks (`from utilsJ.regularimports import *`)
